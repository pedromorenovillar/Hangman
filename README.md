# The hangman

> My take on replit's 100 days of code [day 39 challenge](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python/hub?utm_source=widget). It involves creating a hangman game to practise lists, string manipulation, slicing, etc.

### Requirements

- Prompt the user to type in a letter.
- Check if the letter is in the word.
- If it does, output the word with all blanks apart from the letter(s) they've already guessed.
- Keep a running list of the letters they've used.
- Count how many times they've picked a letter that isn't in the word - more than 6 and they lose.
- Output a 'win' message if they reveal all the letters.


ðŸ¥³ Extra points for using ASCII art to draw the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
